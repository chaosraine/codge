## Capsule Pantry 3 - Recipes
This is critically important: “recipes” as in written instructions that I need to have in front of my face and follow to the letter, have (almost) no place in my meal planning. I stick to things I can prepare without a recipe - I use techniques instead, such as those in my regular [meal templates or mindless meals.](https://nerdishmom.com/executive-dysfunction-in-the-kitchen/)
So for minimalist meal planning, I made a list of meals and/or meal _categories_ that we make all the time. It wasn't quite long enough to my mind, so I added a few things to it that are meals we don't eat often now, but that don't require me to learn any new recipes - things like omelets, and beans and rice. 
I went overboard the first time and realized I overplanned (specifying exactly which three meals a day we should cook every day for a month) which is literally exactly the opposite of what I'm trying to do here, so I went through again and simplified it. 
I'd recommend sticking to absolutely no more than 10 meals/categories on this list - fewer also works if you don't have a brain that's screaming at you "WHAT ABOUT VARIETY THOUGH??" 
Note also that vagueness in your categories is fine. I've got "meat and veg," "Tex-Mex," and "soup" on my list which are all impossibly vague. The idea is that, at least to begin, that I understand that even though the categories are enormous, that my options aren't, because I'm limited by the things I know how to cook already, and that I have ingredients for in my limited inventory. 
This isn’t just reinventing "Taco Tuesday" like it’s an original idea. Minimalist meal planning does use the same kinds of meal categories, but the *genius* here lies in the overlapping ingredients and the constraint provided by the capsule pantry. Setting it up ahead of time - matching ingredients to meals - will take a decent amount of effort. I'd recommend talking it over with a partner if there's another adult you generally share meals with. But unlike typical meal planning which has to be done again and again every week, this process is meant to mostly just be done once - with minor tweaking as seasons change (figuratively but also literally when it comes to produce) instead of starting all over again each week.
Of course, the ingredients and recipes will vary WILDLY from home to home. In the end, mine are:  
1. Pasta  
2. Stir fry or curry  
3. Brinner/eggs  
4. Sandwich  
5. Meat/veg  
6. Tex-Mex  
7. Casserole  
8. Soup  
9. Beans & rice  
10. Prepared foods (kind of cheating...But I like cheating)
