# Red Beans and Rice
#recipes
## Ingredients
-   1 (16 ounce) package dry red kidney beans 
-   3 stalks celery, chopped 
-   1 medium onion, coarsely chopped 
-   1 green bell pepper, chopped 
-   6 large cloves garlic, peeled 
-   2 tablespoons vegetable oil 
-   2 teaspoons dried thyme 
-   1 teaspoon dried oregano 
-   ½ teaspoon ground black pepper 
-   ½ teaspoon ground cumin 
-   ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper 
-   8 cups water, divided 
-   4 dashes liquid smoke flavoring 
-   2 bay leaves 
-   1 cup uncooked white rice 
-   salt to taste

## Directions

1. Place red beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let soak, 8 hours to overnight. Drain and rinse.
2. Add celery, onion, bell pepper, and garlic to a blender and process until just shy of a puree.
3. Add vegetable oil to a saucepan or stockpot over medium heat. Cook and stir vegetable mixture for 5 minutes. Add thyme, oregano, black pepper, cumin, and cayenne pepper. Cook, stirring regularly, for 2 minutes more.
4. Add 6 cups water, the beans, liquid smoke, and bay leaves. Stir to combine and turn heat up to high. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and let simmer until beans begin to fall apart, 2 to 3 hours.
5. Bring remaining water and rice to a boil in another saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
6. Pour most of the cooking liquid from the beans into a bowl and reserve. Remove bay leaves. Mash about 1/3 of the beans, adding as much of the reserved liquid as necessary to reach preferred thickness. Mix with the unmashed beans and season with salt. Serve beans over rice.
## Cook's Notes:
More or less rice may be needed, depending on your preferences. I like brown rice to make it even healthier. After cooking,
you can stir in 1 tablespoon butter to add some vegetarian-friendly (but decidedly not vegan) richness.
## Tips
This will thicken a lot upon cooling. You may want to reserve the extra liquid in the refrigerator if intending to keep leftovers.

The number of servings indicated is for eating as a main dish. As a side, it will make approximately twice as many servings.
