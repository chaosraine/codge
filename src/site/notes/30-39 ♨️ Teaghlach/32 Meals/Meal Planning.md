## Meal Planning
I have two basic systems that I use for meal planning. They're related, but one has much more structure than the other. They both build upon the ideas I laid out in [[10-19 üí¢ Bardacht/15 Blog/Blog 2021/2021-03-26-executive-dysfunction-in-the-kitchen\|Executive Dysfunction in the Kitchen]]. 

If you follow me on Ko-Fi, you've probably already heard of the first method: My [[30-39 ‚ô®Ô∏è Teaghlach/32 Meals/Capsule Pantry- A minimalist meal plan\|Capsule Pantry]], which was released as a series of (mostly) shorter posts. I tend to fall back on the capsule pantry when things are hard in other areas of my life. It involves no meal planning - I just keep my pantry stocked with the same foods all the time, and make a lot of simple things like spaghetti and meatballs, frozen chicken fingers, quesadillas, etc... Things I can throw together in 15-20 minutes even if I haven't thought about dinner once all day.

The second system is a lot more of a *system* and does involve some actual meal planning. But it's meal planning you do ONCE and then just repeat. 

I got inspired by meal planning services that exist out there. They don't send you actual ingredients like a meal kit service, they just send a menu for each week with an ingredient list for you to take to the grocery store. But in my experience, efficient meal planning just has too many variables for a third party to do a very good job doing it for me, especially every single week. Even a service that does a great job of being efficient with ingredients one week is probably not going to remember that you had to buy a pound of miso last week and you still have to use it up...

I used the same ingredient list that I made for my capsule pantry to create a [[30-39 ‚ô®Ô∏è Teaghlach/32 Meals/5-week meal plan\|5-week meal plan]] specialized for my family. If you're interested in trying it out, feel free to use my meal plan as a basis for forming your own, although of course it will work best if you make your plan customized for your own household needs. These Obsidian checklists are literally the plans I use for shopping and cooking our meals each week.

The 5-week meal plan has the added benefit of offering more home-cooked/from scratch recipes without any more weeknight effort, because I can spend one day a week cooking and prepping foods to eat throughout the week. After I'm done prepping, I have something like I might get from a meal kit, but a lot more meals for a lot less money. Since the rotation is 5 weeks, variety is no concern.

Of course with either system, there's no reason to be inflexible. I'm welcome to add in a new recipe or try something different any time I'm feeling up to it. The point is just to not try to do *everything new all the time* and end up with a lot of food waste from the things I never got around to cooking.
