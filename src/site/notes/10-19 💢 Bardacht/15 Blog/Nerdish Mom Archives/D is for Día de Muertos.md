_Día de Muertos_ is a primarily Mexican celebration of the dead which takes place October 31-November 2. It came about from the merging of All Saints Day traditions brought over by the Spanish with the native Aztec beliefs that were in place long before they arrival of Catholicism.

As opposed to the solemn All Saints Day remembrances elsewhere in the Americas, _Día de los Muertos_ is a joyful tradition when families get to honor their lost loved ones, and has it has tremendous religious and cultural significance to the people who celebrate it.

However, I am not from a culture which celebrates _Día de Muertos_ and my experience extends little beyond the movie _Coco_. As such, I believe it’s my place to make sure my kids have an understanding of the holiday and the culture surrounding it, but that I should not be the one to teach it.

Luckily, the internet is full of latina/os who want to share their tradition with children around the world! So I’ll keep things here short so you can check them out instead.

\*If you are not from a culture that celebrates _Día de Muertos_, there's still plenty of fun to be had! Instead of crafts such as making _calaveras_, remember that honoring the dead is a tradition found in all cultures, so look into a way you can do it to support your own heritage. Make an altar in your own tradition instead of a Mexican _ofrenda_ and offer up your own comfort foods to your ancestors!
