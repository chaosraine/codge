Y'all something big happened but I want to go ahead and finish up the month before I bring it up. It's not breaking news or anything at this point so it can wait. And it's not that we just submitted an offer on a house for the first time ever which also happened.

What I am going to talk about is…

## **V is for Vampires**

I did a lot of research on vampires way back when I wrote a vampire novel. Mostly it was reading Dracula and Wikipedia but you know… That's expert level right? 

### **Hydrophobia?** 

One of the things I found most interesting is that vampire stories came from real-life accounts of vampires. 

And one of the things now thought to explain the vampire sightings is hydrophobia, or rabies. 

[Medical News Today](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321780.php) goes into several common traits between rabies and vampirism, including a tendency to bite, hypersexuality, insomnia, and an aversion to strong stimuli- like the smell of garlic or light bouncing off a mirror.

### **Vampires for kids**

Some of my favorite vampires may not be the most kid friendly (Like Lestat? Or Spike? Probably not…) But there are plenty out there who are great for kids. I had my daughter tell me her favorite TV vampires and what she likes about them.

- **Drac (Super Monsters)** 

He knows how to fly. And has sharp teeth the same as me. And has a cape.

- **Vampirina (Vampirina)** 

Turns into a bat. And knows how to fly when in bat. Vampirina sings the same as me. "Home scream home!" 

- **Marceline (Adventure Time)** 

Sucked Jake's blood but only pretend. Marceline flies. Friends with Finn and Jake and Ice King, and Princess Bubblegum. Turns into Marshmallow-ine.
