## About the Ex-Gifted Podcast:

If you are a former gifted kid who grew up to struggle with basic adulting, then you need the Ex-Gifted podcast.

Host Ren Eliza talks about gifted kid burnout, and the damage that lasts long into adulthood. Damage like battered self esteem, decimated internal motivation, and a continued failure to live up to expectations even while we were placed on pedestals and alienated from our peers.

Ex-Gifted will cover failure, procrastination, imposter syndrome, and chronic anxiety and depression, and a whole lot more.

Each episode also offers suggestions to deal with your executive dysfunction in adulthood so you can rebuild the systems that allowed you to shine so brightly in childhood.

Weâ€™re making exceptional children into functional adults.

Thanks!

**Topic:**

Hours and days pass you by without even noticing. You're not always aware of the passage of time, you're never sure about what you want to do or when. Building a flexible time management system can actually help give you more time to reach your goals and do the things you love.

For many of us, the issue of time management is a non-starter, because we have a poor sense of time in the first place.Â 

If you do not have a good concept of time. How can you possibly even begin to manage it? There's basically two parts to this. You work to develop at least a little bit of a sense of time and at the same time you go forward with what you have, allowing technology to help you keep track of time when it eludes you.

**What can we do about it?**

1\. Start small, and start foundational. Use habit stacking.Â 

2\. Use tools to outsource your time sense

3\. Use timers to keep track of the passage of time

4\. Try thinking about your time over a week, instead of a day.Â 

5\. These systems are not fixed
