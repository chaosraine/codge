## Transcript









**PROBLEM?**

**Topic:**

Your mind is possibly the most important thing you can get organized, and it so rarely comes up - even for people with executive dysfunction, but think about it - your world is basically what‚Äôs inside your head (your ideas), what‚Äôs outside your head (your environment and belongings), and the interaction between those two things (your actions and how you spend your time). All of those things can and should be kept more organized if you want to achieve your goals.

  

Idea management is especially important to people like us who have a million ideas that we want to be able to save to contemplate later. Here are some ways to save your working memory for the things that matter.

  

**What can we do about it?**

1\. Throw out the thoughts that don‚Äôt spark joy.

2\. Write. Shit. Down.

3\. Always have a way to take notes.

4\. Mind management is self-care.

5\. Make time for your mind.
