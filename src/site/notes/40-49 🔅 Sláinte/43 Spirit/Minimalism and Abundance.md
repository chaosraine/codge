[[40-49 ðŸ”… SlÃ¡inte/49 epic minimalism/epicurean minimalism\|Epic Minimalism]] is a curious thing. I would expect it to be about asceticism, self-denial, and - y'know - [[minimalism\|minimalism]]. It's right there in the name, after all. 

But what's the point of minimizing if not to enhance my life? 

This is another element of the [[40-49 ðŸ”… SlÃ¡inte/49 epic minimalism/The minimalist paradox\|The minimalist paradox]]. By minimizing things that don't bring me joy, I have more space for an abundance of the things that do.

This is the whole point of Epic Minimalism. Not to improve my life through minimalism itself, but through the process of maximizing the best things in my life by reducing everything else.
