## Suburban foraging
The park where I forage has a ton of assorted edible plants all just growing wildly along the walking path. Today I discovered what looked like grapes. I asked [plant.id](https://plant.id) and although I didn't get a perfect ID, all the suggested possibilities were.... grapes. There were also a ton of wild raspberries growing through there earlier in the season, and a mulberry tree. I'm really unclear on if all of those things are just there or if some of them were intentionally planted. I highly doubt the blackberry was placed there on purpose.

Maybe I'm just coming more aware of plants in general, and those good for foraging specifically. I hope to go out to more places as the weather gets nicer and see if I find anything elsewhere to spread the love a bit.

## Foraging at home
Mostly foraging refers to finding plants in the wild or in public, but as I'm still learning stuff, I still find new things in my own garden as well. Most recently, that has been this little succulent-looking thing (spoiler alert, it is a succulent)

I love how it looks, so I've been weeding around it, even though it seems to have sprouted from nowhere. I asked plant.id, which seemed pretty confident it was [[purslane\|purslane]].

Once I knew what it (probably) was, I started feeling like a very good witch for instinctively wanting more of this stuff. But then I saw warnings that *spurge* can be mistaken for purslane. Luckily, I learned there were a few tell-tale signs to distinguish them. I went back out to check *my* plant to see which one it appeared to be.

This is what I saw:

For those not in the know, this is a photo of purslane, edible and full of omega 3s on the left, and spurge, toxic and yucky on the right.

Although embarrassing, this is actually an ideal outcome for a forager. I lucked into a situation where an edible plant, and its toxic look-alike are *right* next to each other. I wish it were always this easy!
