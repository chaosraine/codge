## In the Garden
I don't remember where my first lemon balm plant came from, exactly, but I didn't know a lot about when I planted it.

Pro-tip: **LEMON BALM IS HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE**

At least in my area, lemon balm spreads and a little bit becomes a lot very quickly. I grow a lot of mint, and the lemon balm is maybe 25%-50% worse even than mint. I can harvest it down to the roots and then come back a couple weeks later and there's a whole crop again. If you do want to plant it outside without dedicating an entire bed to it, strongly consider growing it in a pot.

It smells lovely though, and in particular it has a scent reminiscent of something like lemon pledge. It just seems like a perfect match for a cleaner.

## Properties

Apparently lemon balm has some effect on thyroid hormone behavior and may act as a mild sedative, so it is **NOT** recommended as a supplement for people on thyroid medications, or who are on sedatives. Of course, consult your physician before taking any supplements. [Mount Sinai on lemon balm](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/herb/lemon-balm)
