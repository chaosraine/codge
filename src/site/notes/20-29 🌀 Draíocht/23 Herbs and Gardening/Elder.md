## Elderflower

I was honestly pretty worried about correctly identifying this plant when I first spotted it, so I didn't end up making anything from the flowers, but I **love** elderflower liqueur and making some of my own, or an elderflower syrup I can mix in with some carbonated water sounds heavenly. 

Unfortunately, I'll be waiting until summer 2024 for that. In my part of the world, *Sambucus* flowers in late June, around the time of [[20-29 ðŸŒ€ DraÃ­ocht/24 Celebrations and the WOTY/Litha\|Litha]].
## Elderberry
First elderberry harvest! Not bad for [[20-29 ðŸŒ€ DraÃ­ocht/23 Herbs and Gardening/foraging\|foraging]].

I have some elder at home but itâ€™s pretty young and hasnâ€™t flowered so far. It's an ornamental and is supposed to be beautiful if it ever actually flowers for me...

No flowers, no berries. In the new house I intend to plant plenty of it. 

Be careful with identifying Elder, as there are different varieties and only some are safe to consume. In general, elderberries should be cooked before consuming and the seeds strained out. *Sambucus nigra* or European elderberry is the best known species, though the subspecies [*S nigra canadensis*](https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/sambucus-canadensis/) and *[S nigra caerulea](https://landscapeplants.oregonstate.edu/plants/sambucus-nigra-subsp-cerulea)* aka *S mexicana* are native to North America. Sidenote that the blue berries on the latter are *stunning.*

Elderberry is taken for its [antiviral properties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4848651/), and is often made into a medicinal syrup combined with honey, ginger, and/or lemon. Pretty classic herbal remedy stuff for making into a tea for cold and flu season. As with lemon and honey, it should not be used as an alternative to a flu vaccine, but may shorten the duration of a cold, or ease symptoms.
