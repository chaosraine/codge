Like Tarot, Lenormand is a *type* of #divination cards. 

[[20-29 ðŸŒ€ DraÃ­ocht/21 Divination/001-Cartomancy\|001-Cartomancy]] is an extremely simple way to get started with a magic practice, and can be incorporated into a daily journaling practice. I like to use the cards I have drawn as a journaling prompt, and often do a reading first thing in the morning to set the tone for my day. Although any divination practice can be used in this way, I especially like Lenormand because of its focus on the everyday. It's a way for me to incorporate magic into the mundane.

What makes Lenormand unique is that they are always read at a minimum of two at a time. In a two-card reading, the first card drawn acts as the noun or subject, and the second as the modifier. Lenormand decks also do not use *reversals*, but it's worth noting that reversals are not universal among tarot either, and in fact the Thoth Tarot deck I use does not use reversals.
