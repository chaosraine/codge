In the [[20-29 ðŸŒ€ DraÃ­ocht/24 Celebrations and the WOTY/24 Celebrations and the WOTY\|Wheel of the Year]] Mabon is the festival held for the Autumn Equinox, usually around September 20-24 in the Northern Hemisphere. Mabon is a harvest festival, and celebrations surrounding picking apples, or other seasonal crops such as [[20-29 ðŸŒ€ DraÃ­ocht/23 Herbs and Gardening/Elder#Elderberry\|elderberries]] are appropriate at this time.

I've also discussed Mabon and the Wheel of the Year as one way I mark the passage of time on the podcast. Find it here: [[10-19 ðŸ’¢ Bardacht/16 Podcast/Episodes 2022/2022-09-20-the-autumn-equinox-and-time-agnosia\|The Autumn Equinox and Time Agnosia]]
