P is for the Pumpkin Patch and Picking Perfect Pumpkins!

If you don't already know where there's one near you, or if you're in a rural area trying to find what's closest, try [Pumpkin Patches and More](https://pumpkinpatchesandmore.org/). Be forewarned that they've been gathering links for _years_ which means that they've got a lot of broken links. If you do find one that's broken, at least you know the name to look for though!

Most pumpkin patches have a lot more than just pumpkin picking, with things like petting zoos or harvest festival activities like hay rides.

We have our pumpkin picking scheduled for two days from now so I'll let you know how it went!

P.S. As for Halloween specials, I love Curious George: A Halloween Boo Fest and the legend of No-Noggin - who kicks hats off trick-or-treaters every Halloween. If you think about it, that's actually scarier than the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow who isn't known for doing anything but walking near people!
