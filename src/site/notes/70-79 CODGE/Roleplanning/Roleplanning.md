## What is Roleplanning?

### Character Growth

Through skill development, goal setting, and treating life like it's a roleplaying game.

### Handwritten Planning

For keeping your thoughts and managing your time perception.

### Story-Based Habit Tracking

Because tracking streaks just makes you feel bad and fantasy is more fun anyway.

### Level Up IRL

This is the foundation of the Roleplanning System. Embody your values and have fun doing it!

### One place to keep track of all your systems

Always check your inventory! That's where you can keep tabs on the systems you will use in this journey.

## Frequently asked questions

Why 13 weeks?

Thirteen weeks is 91 days, so almost exactly one quarter of the year or 3 months. Since the planner pages are undated, you can start any time you want, not just at the beginning of the month or the year.

This is a perfect balance between long-term goals (main quests), short-term goals (side quests), and skill development. Depending on your quests, you will probably be able to complete 1-2 side quests, whereas it's a great opportunity to make and track progress on your main quest. And it's right in the sweet spot for advancing your skills while still being able to reflect on them in a meaningful way.

In short: it's long enough that at the end you can see some progress but short enough to not be overwhelming.

Will I need to buy again every 13 weeks?

Definitely not. The starter kit comes with monthlies through March of the next year (2023) and since the one-time-purchase planners are undated, you can reuse them endlessly. When you get to the end, just start over. Even at the end of the year you're free to just delete the months you don't need anymore and reuse the blank planner pages.

Even the adventure maps can be reused as habit trackers and journal prompts, but of course there won't be many surprises left in that case.

Why sell a planner as a subscription?

Keeping digital planners updated is ongoing work. I offer dated pages through a subscription model, so you always have the pages you need as long as you're subscribed and you always have the newest designs and layouts.

Additionally - one of the ways that the Roleplanning System is unique is the habit trackers which change regularly and are formatted as short stories. Any subscription that includes maps is delivering these stories straight to your planner pages as inspiration!

The absolute biggest reason for the subscription is the _one-on-one help_ you can get, not just with troubleshooting and technical questions, but with the actual core aspects of leveling up in real life. Subscribers at certain levels get access to a private Discord channel and one-on-one accountability sessions to make sure you're completing your quests and enjoying your journey at the same time.

Cancel your subscription anytime, but keep everything you've downloaded already to reuse when you want.

Can I still use the Roleplanning System without subscribing?

Of course! As long as you are fine with spending the 10 seconds each week writing the dates in, and you don't need the one-on-one guidance, there's no need to subscribe. That's why the one-off purchase options are there!

To keep your system up to date, just buy new maps a la carte or in combo packs as you get close to the end, and the same for calendars. You don't need to buy new layouts or redesigns unless you just want them.

Find everything you need to update your current Roleplanning System without a subscription under "expansion packs" in the shop!

## Leveling up

### If you're already using the Roleplanning System but find leveling up or setting attributes to be too confusing, or if you're just curious and want to know more about how the system works before you start using it yourself, here's the ultimate guide to leveling up!

## Using CP to set attributes and level up

Confidence Points (or CP) are the in-game currency you earn through personal growth and skill development in the Roleplanning System. In other games or systems you earn some kind of experience just by taking a bunch of action, and you automatically gain levels as you go. This represents the idea that if you do something enough that it gets easier and you get better. But CP is instead a very subjective currency because I wanted to represent my own experience that simply doing something a lot has never been indicative of dominance in that area. Otherwise we'd all be gourmet chefs just a few years and 10k meals on our own.  
  
Instead, CP is a very subjective currency. You gain CP by becoming more confident in a skill. You may cook dinner every night, and feel like it's a constant struggle. Cooking may still be a developing skill that you only feel slightly confident about, despite having done it thousands of times. But with a few tweaks, you might find that you can conquer cooking in just a matter of weeks, which would earn you a ton of CP!  
The point is that even though you do something a lot, it may still not be second nature to you. In my experience, few things truly come easy enough to be considered second nature.

## CP is just a guideline

I'll let you in on a little secret:  
I don't personally use the CP table.  
I just go with my gut and level up when it feels right to me. I developed the CP table only for people who weren't comfortable with that and felt frozen when they had to try to set their attributes or level up.  
  
If you're not sure where to start, let CP guide you. If you think it's silly to try to assign numbers to such a subjective measure, then just ignore the CP table entirely.

## If leveling is too easy

If you find yourself thinking that the values in the CP table are entirely too low and that once you count up every single skill that you would already be level 20 in all attributes, then that's fine. Adjust the numbers to your liking. Or forgo them altogether!  
  
Like I said, it's a guideline. I usually only look at a handful of skills in each attribute but I'm sure if you analyzed it closely enough you could find hundreds of skills in every attribute and that would quickly inflate your scores over what I intended. I imagine it would also quickly become exhausting.  
  
But what I intended doesn't matter. There's no one for you to compete against and so no possible way to cheat. Make the levels go to 100 instead of 20 if you like. Do whatever you need to do in order to make it work for you.

## If leveling is too hard

If it feels like all your attributes are only level 1-2 and that it will be impossible to level up, then here are some possible tweaks to make it work for you:  
Brainstorm at least 10 skills for each attribute that you could possibly do. Even if you think you would get 0 CP for the skill right now, write it down. Chances are that when you were just thinking about how low you were in an attribute that you missed some skills that just about everyone has.  
  
If you still need help, check out the page on [skill suggestions](http://roleplanning.com/skills). And if you STILL need help, then just reduce all of the numbers in the level up table.  
  
Remember that life isn't a competition so there's no such thing as cheating, just accommodating your own ability.

## What systems belong in your inventory?

Well that's a big question, huh? Let's start with this one:

### What are systems?

Systems are just the things you use and do in order to make your life easier or work more efficiently.

### Okay then what are some examples?

Well...Roleplanning is a system. It's just a way to keep track of your progress and your goals, to-dos, and events. But you'll need more than just that to actually accomplish said goals.

Some other examples:

1. Habit stacking/Implementation intentions
2. Routines (or a routine app like the [Fabulous app](https://www.thefabulous.co/premium/90-day-guest-pass?name=Ren&utm_source=email&utm_campaign=guestpass&utm_term=90_day_guest_pass))
3. To-do lists or apps like [Todoist](https://todoist.com/r/lauren_reese_eugpzq) (if you try premium we both get 2 free months - but the free version is great on its own!) or Microsoft To-Do
4. A notebook, or apps like Google Keep, Trello, or Evernote
5. Techniques like GTD, pomodoro, autofocus
6. Repeating schedules such as for workouts, meal planning, or cleaning
7. Organization bins and techniques at home or work
8. And SO MUCH MORE

You may notice that if you want, you can keep track of most of these things within the Roleplanning System. You can make your to-do lists, write out routines or schedules, plan out any implementation intentions you want.

"Okay I'm starting to understand what this means, but I'm still wondering..."

## What do I actually write in my inventory?

1. The name/description of a system you use (or will start using)
2. How exactly you will implement that system

The inventory is a place for you to keep track of the kinds of systems you are interested in using to level up your skills and complete your quests.

For one - your steed is the main system (or systems) you will need to complete your main quest. This is generally going to be an implementation intention that breaks down the steps and defines exactly What, Where, and When (and potentially how) you are going to work on that goal.

If your quest is to run a marathon, your steed might be a plan to What: run, Where: in the park, When: 6 AM, How: following a training schedule you chose (note the training schedule is also a system).

So what you write will be specific to your intentions with roleplanning, and also with what kinds of systems appeal to you. Perhaps you are looking to build up your self-care and habit stacking goes to the top of your inventory list.

You also need to include how you will implement the system. For habit stacking, that means that you write down both the specific cue, and the action you will take.
