## About the move
I have a move coming up in June 2024. It's not cross-country or anything, but it is to the next state over, about 90 minutes away.
It's my goal to not wait until the last minute to pack up and prepare for this move, especially since this will be my first time selling a house.
Since moving is something a lot of people have to deal with, and can be a huge struggle, I want to document the process to hopefully be helpful to other people. This is definitely another example of [[60-69 〰️ Dialann/68 Using Obsidian/Learning in Public\|Learning in Public]] as I experiment with what works and doesn't work for me as far as move preparations.

This page is meant to hold the outline/timeline/countdown until the move.

I'd love to see if there was some way to see the tasks grouped by room, by month, or by type (ie decluttering, cleaning, packing, etc...) depending on exactly what I want (without making individual notes for each one.) Dataview tasks with inline properties maybe?
