## New this week
Tragedy!! My computer just suddenly died absolutely out of nowhere on Monday. I haven't been able to get it repaired, and this has severely impaired my ability to update the website, or indeed do anything in Obsidian at all, as I was in the process of switching over to Obsidian Git for syncing my files instead of using iCloud (which was incredibly slow, especially with my phone on the beta version of iOS. Do not recommend this particular combo of software choices.)
