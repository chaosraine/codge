Here's the prize for everyone who participated in #30toClean!

It's a cleaning tracker and journal that includes a few challenges and prompts plus a couple of stickers for doing your work. It comes in a GoodNotes notebook, an annotatable pdf (with links to the stickers), or a printable pdf booklet (it's meant to be printed two-sided to fit on 8.5x11 paper and folded over). Download any or all and feel free to use it as many times as you want!

It includes just enough space to mark it twice a day for a month, once a day for two months, or about 62 times whenever you get around to cleaning. Streaks don't matter and the squares are undated so you use it whenever you want and there's no blank spaces to make you feel bad!
