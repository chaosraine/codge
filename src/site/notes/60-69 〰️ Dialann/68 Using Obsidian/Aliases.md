An alias allows me to refer to a single note by multiple different names in [[60-69 〰️ Dialann/68 Using Obsidian/Obsidian\|Obsidian]] using [[60-69 〰️ Dialann/68 Using Obsidian/Resources/Markdown\|Markdown]] 

[[60-69 〰️ Dialann/68 Using Obsidian/My First Week with Obsidian\|My First Week with Obsidian]]

An alias can be defined in [[60-69 〰️ Dialann/68 Using Obsidian/YAML frontmatter\|YAML frontmatter]] or by using a pipe in the link 
eg: 
```
[[note title|alias]]
```
