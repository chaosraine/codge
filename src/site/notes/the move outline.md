## About the move
I have a move coming up in June 2024. It's not cross-country or anything, but it is to the next state over, about 90 minutes away.
It's my goal to not wait until the last minute to pack up and prepare for this move, especially since this will be my first time selling a house.
Since moving is something a lot of people have to deal with, and can be a huge struggle, I want to document the process to hopefully be helpful to other people.

This page is meant to hold the outline/timeline/countdown until the move.
